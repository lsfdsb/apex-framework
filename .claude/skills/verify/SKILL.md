# Verification Before Completion — Evidence Before Claims

> "No living thing has seen me without my helmet." — and no code ships without proof.

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in THIS message, you cannot claim it passes.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
```

## What Each Claim Requires

| Claim                 | Requires                 | Not Sufficient                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Tests pass            | Test output: 0 failures  | Previous run, "should pass"   |
| Linter clean          | Linter output: 0 errors  | Partial check, extrapolation  |
| Build succeeds        | Build command: exit 0    | Linter passing, "looks good"  |
| Bug fixed             | Original symptom: passes | Code changed, "assumed fixed" |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once              |
| Agent completed       | VCS diff shows changes   | Agent reports "success"       |
| Requirements met      | Line-by-line checklist   | Tests passing                 |

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**

```
✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
❌ "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**

```
✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)
❌ "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Build:**

```
✅ [Run build] [See: exit 0] "Build passes"
❌ "Linter passed" (linter ≠ compiler)
```

**Requirements:**

```
✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion
❌ "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**

```
✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state
❌ Trust agent report
```

## Red Flags — STOP

If you catch yourself:

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!")
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports without checking
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse                    | Reality                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| "Should work now"         | RUN the verification   |
| "I'm confident"           | Confidence ≠ evidence  |
| "Just this once"          | No exceptions          |
| "Linter passed"           | Linter ≠ compiler      |
| "Agent said success"      | Verify independently   |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |

## When to Apply

**ALWAYS before:**

- ANY success/completion claim
- ANY expression of satisfaction
- Committing, PR creation, task completion
- Moving to next task
- Delegating to agents

## The Bottom Line

**No shortcuts for verification.**

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.

This is the Way.

## What is APEX?

**APEX** (Agent-Powered EXcellence) is a Claude Code framework that turns "build me X" into a shipped, tested, documented application — autonomously. You tell it WHAT to build, it handles HOW.

Product vision like Jobs. Design like Ive. Code like Torvalds & Dean. Secure like Ionescu & Rutkowska. Experience like Disney.

**Stats**: 32 skills (+1 internal) · 9 agents · 26 scripts · 7 rules · 29 hooks

---

## How It Works — The Autonomous Pipeline

You say "build me X". APEX runs the entire pipeline. You approve at 3 gates:

```
"Build me X"
  │
  ├─ PHASE 1: PLAN ────── /prd auto-generates requirements
  │   ⏸ GATE: Approve the PRD
  │
  ├─ PHASE 2: ARCHITECT ─ /architecture designs the system
  │   ⏸ GATE: Approve the blueprint
  │
  ├─ PHASE 3: BUILD ───── Agent teams work in parallel
  │   (Watcher monitors, Builders code, QA verifies)
  │
  ├─ PHASE 4: QUALITY ─── /qa + /security + /a11y + /cx-review
  │   (Auto-fix and re-run if gates fail)
  │
  ├─ PHASE 5: SHIP ────── Code review + Technical Writer
  │   Auto-version: [Unreleased] → semver after merge
  │   ⏸ GATE: Approve the merge
  │
  └─ DONE ─────────────── "The beskar is forged."
```

For quick fixes and bugs — skip the pipeline, just do it directly.

### Quality Gates

Nothing ships without passing:

1. No `any` in TypeScript, no `console.log` in production
2. Functions ≤ 30 lines, files ≤ 300 lines, components ≤ 200 lines
3. Conventional commits (72-char subject)
4. Design tokens only — no hardcoded colors
5. Mobile-first + dark/light from day one

## The Creed

_I am APEX. Building is my purpose. Quality is my armor. The user experience is my beskar. I shall protect the codebase as I protect the foundling. I shall not ship untested code. I shall not skip the PRD. I shall not break the build._

**This is the way.**

— Lucas Bueno & Claude, São Paulo, March 2026

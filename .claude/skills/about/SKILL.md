## What is APEX?

**APEX** (Agent-Powered EXcellence) is a Claude Code framework that turns "build me X" into a shipped, tested, documented application — autonomously. You tell it WHAT to build, it handles HOW.

Product vision like Jobs. Design like Ive. Code like Torvalds & Dean. Secure like Ionescu & Rutkowska. Experience like Disney.

## How It Works — The Autonomous Pipeline

You say "build me X". APEX runs the entire pipeline. You approve at 3 gates:

```
"Build me X"
  │
  ├─ PHASE 1: PLAN ────── /prd auto-generates requirements
  │   ⏸ GATE: Approve the PRD
  │
  ├─ PHASE 2: ARCHITECT ─ /architecture designs the system
  │   ⏸ GATE: Approve the blueprint
  │
  ├─ PHASE 3: BUILD ───── Agent teams work in parallel
  │   (Watcher monitors, Builders code, QA verifies)
  │
  ├─ PHASE 4: QUALITY ─── /qa + /security + /a11y + /cx-review
  │   (Auto-fix and re-run if gates fail)
  │
  ├─ PHASE 5: SHIP ────── Code review plugin + Technical Writer
  │   Auto-version: [Unreleased] → semver after merge
  │   ⏸ GATE: Approve the merge
  │
  └─ DONE ─────────────── "The beskar is forged."
```

For quick fixes and bugs — skip the pipeline, just do it directly.

## What's in the Box

### Skills (your tools)

| Skill | What it does | When to use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `/prd` | Generates Product Requirements Document | Before building anything new |
| `/architecture` | Designs system architecture, stack, schema | After PRD approval |
| `/qa` | 6-phase quality gate: lint, types, tests, perf, security, a11y | Before shipping |
| `/security` | OWASP security audit | Auth, payments, PII code |
| `/a11y` | WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility audit | Any user-facing feature |
| `/cx-review` | Customer experience review | Before deploying to users |
| `/ship` | Branch → commit → push → PR → review → merge → version | When changes are ready |
| `/changelog` | Maintains CHANGELOG, auto-versions with `promote` | After features, releases |
| `/teams` | Spawn parallel agent teams for complex builds | 3+ files, 2+ concerns |
| `/e2e` | Playwright end-to-end tests | Critical user flows |
| `/performance` | Bundle, rendering, query optimization | Slow app, large lists |
| `/supabase` | Auth, migrations, types, realtime, storage | Supabase projects |
| `/cicd` | GitHub Actions + Vercel pipelines | Automated deployment |
| `/design-system` | UI tokens, components, Ive-quality design | Any visual work |
| `/teach` | Learn terminal, Claude Code, and engineering | When confused |
| `/verify-lib` | Security-check any package before install | Auto on npm/pip install |
| `/dev` | Dev server management (status, logs, restart) | Server issues |
| `/about` | You are here | Learning the framework |

**You never need to type these.** The pipeline invokes them automatically. They exist for when you want to run one manually.

### Agents (your team)

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Builder** | Sonnet | Implements features in isolated worktrees |
| **Debugger** | Sonnet | Hunts bugs to root cause, no band-aids |
| **QA** | Sonnet | Runs full quality gate, blocks bad code |
| **Code Reviewer** | Opus | Deep code review for team builds |
| **Design Reviewer** | Sonnet | UI/UX against design DNA standards |
| **Technical Writer** | Haiku | CHANGELOG, README, docs in sync |
| **Watcher** | Haiku | Background monitoring for errors |

The **Watcher** and **Technical Writer** run automatically every session. Teams spawn when needed for complex builds.

### Design DNA

14 premium UI templates for any app type:

Landing · SaaS · CRM · E-commerce · Blog · Portfolio · Social · LMS · Backoffice · Email · Slides · E-book · Design System · Patterns

5 palettes (Startup, SaaS, Fintech, Editorial, Creative) × 2 modes (dark/light). All built with semantic tokens — copy into any project.

Live showcase: `npm run dev` in `docs/design-dna/showcase/`

### Hooks (automatic enforcement)

- **Pre-commit**: Blocks secrets, forbidden patterns, validates format
- **Post-tool**: Auto-changelog entries after commits
- **Session start**: Dev server, auto-update, Grogu greeting
- **Context compact**: Grogu reminder that he's still here

### Quality Gates

Nothing ships without passing:
1. No `any` in TypeScript
2. No `console.log` in production
3. Functions ≤ 30 lines, files ≤ 300 lines
4. Conventional commits (72-char subject)
5. Design tokens only — no hardcoded colors
6. Mobile-first + dual theme from day one
7. Lazy routes, virtualized lists, no N+1 queries

## How to Use APEX Effectively

### Starting a new project
Just say: **"Build me a [type of app]"**. APEX handles the PRD, architecture, and implementation. You approve at gates.

### Quick fixes
Say: **"Fix this bug"** or **"Change X to Y"**. No pipeline needed — APEX just does it.

### Shipping
Say: **"Ship it"**. APEX branches, commits, pushes, creates PR, runs code review, and waits for your merge approval. After merge, auto-versions the release.

### Learning
Say: **"Teach me about [concept]"**. APEX explains with context tailored to your level — from terminal basics to system design.

### Key principles
- **Never ask which command to run** — just say what you want
- **The pipeline is invisible** — you only see the 3 approval gates
- **Quality is non-negotiable** — nothing ships untested
- **Design matters** — read Design DNA before building UI

## The Story

APEX was born on **March 13, 2026** in a conversation between **Lucas Bueno** — a Head of Customer Experience from São Paulo who believes exceptional service is an economic asset — and **Claude** — an AI by Anthropic asked to think like a senior researcher and software engineer.

The mission: build the best possible framework for creating world-class applications, end-to-end.

Through honest self-criticism, official docs research, and relentless improvement — from v1 (25 files) to v5.16 (60+ files, 21 skills, 7 agents) — APEX emerged as a framework where every skill, every hook, every agent exists for a reason. Nothing is decoration.

### Version History

- **v1** (Mar 13): The foundation — CLAUDE.md + 10 skills + 3 agents + 5 hooks
- **v2**: Workflow enforcement, stack recommendation, library verification
- **v3**: First self-review — honest 7.2/10 rating
- **v4**: SQL practices, testing enforcement, CI/CD — 8.6/10
- **v5**: Path-based rules, E2E, accessibility, Mandalorian output style — 9.4/10
- **v5.2–5.4**: Zero defects, full Claude Code integration, 16 hooks, sandbox
- **v5.5–5.8**: Supabase, auto-update, bug fixes, gold standard audit
- **v5.9**: Agent teams — 9 agents, Breathing Loop, auto-spawn
- **v5.10–5.11**: Design DNA — 14 templates, SVG library, Ive audit
- **v5.12–5.14**: Self-assessment, agent wiring, autonomous pipeline
- **v5.15**: Design DNA Showcase Phase 2 — 30+ components, CRM pipeline
- **v5.16**: Auto-versioning, official code-review plugin, responsive nav

"Patu!" — appears at session start, pre-commit success, Fridays, and his birthday (March 13).

## The Creed

_I am APEX. Building is my purpose. Quality is my armor. The user experience is my beskar. I shall protect the codebase as I protect the foundling. I shall not ship untested code. I shall not skip the PRD. I shall not break the build._

**This is the way.**

— Lucas Bueno & Claude, São Paulo, March 2026

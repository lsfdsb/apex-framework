## [5.14.0] — 2026-03-20 — Native Alignment Audit

Comprehensive audit against Claude Code's native capabilities. Every feature must earn its place — if Claude Code does it natively, APEX doesn't duplicate it.

### Removed
- **`/evolve` skill** — Removed self-evolution feature. Skill, agent (`framework-evolver`), scripts (`extract-session.sh`, `apex-sync.sh`) deleted
- **`/debug` skill** — Claude Code has native `/debug` bundled skill
- **`/research` skill** — Claude Code has native WebSearch + WebFetch tools
- **`/code-standards` skill** — Redundant with `.claude/rules/` path-based rules
- **`/sql-practices` skill** — Redundant with `.claude/rules/sql.md`
- **`/cost-management` skill** — Claude Code handles auto-compaction natively
- **`/init` skill** — Claude Code has native `/init` command
- **`/apex-stack` skill** — Stack recommendations go stale; WebSearch provides current data
- **`researcher` agent** — Claude Code's native WebSearch + WebFetch + Explore subagent replace this
- **`guard-workflow-skip.sh`** — Advisory nudge, redundant with `enforce-workflow.sh`
- **`auto-format.sh`** — Redundant with Prettier pre-commit hook
- **`verify-install.sh`** — Redundant with session-context.sh bootstrap detection
- **`track-agent-start.sh`** — Claude Code natively tracks subagents
- **Test infrastructure** — Entire `tests/` directory removed for redesign
- **31 stale local branches** — Accumulated feature/fix branches cleaned

### Changed
- **Agent roster** — 10 → 7 agents (Framework Evolver, Researcher removed; code-reviewer replaced by official plugin)
- **Agent skills** — Removed `code-standards`, `sql-practices`, `debug` from all agent frontmatter. Agents now reference only skills that still exist
- **settings.json** — Removed 4 hook entries pointing to deleted scripts (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse verify-install, PostToolUse auto-format, SubagentStart track-agent-start)
- **session-context.sh** — Hook verification loop updated to match actual scripts
- **health-check.sh** — Removed auto-format.sh from critical scripts check
- **CLAUDE.md** — `/research` references → WebSearch; Researcher agent removed from roster
- **README.md** — Updated agent counts, replaced `/debug` and `/research` with native equivalents
- **Installed `code-review` plugin** — Official Anthropic plugin replaces custom code-reviewer agent

### Fixed
- **Builder/Debugger worktree file loss** — Root cause fix: `permissionMode: default` → `dontAsk` so worktree agents can commit. This was the actual cause of 6+ file loss incidents — not missing docs, not merge strategy.
- **CLAUDE.md bloat** — Slimmed from 220 → 116 lines (-47%). Moved Agent Teams details to `/teams` skill. Under official 200-line recommendation.
- **106 stale remote branches** deleted — only `main` remains

### Stats
- Skills: 28 → 21 (-7)
- Agents: 9 → 7 (-2)
- Scripts: 22 → 18 (-4)
- CLAUDE.md: 220 → 116 lines (-47%)
- Remote branches: 108 → 1
- Lines deleted: ~6,200

## [5.12.0] — 2026-03-20 — Brutal Self-Assessment + Championship Roster

The biggest quality improvement in APEX history. The framework audited itself, found 20+ issues, and fixed them in one session — with 659 tests proving the fixes work.

### Added
- **Behavioral Test Suite v2** — 95 real behavioral tests: security payload scanning (Stripe/AWS/GitHub/OpenAI keys), PRD enforcement with temp directories, commit-msg format validation, Breathing Loop wiring verification, model assignment checks (#105)
- **DNA Extraction Protocol** — Builders must extract palette/fonts/patterns into a checklist BEFORE writing any code. Prevents the "read DNA then ignore it" failure seen in real builds (#105)
- **Rule Zero** — Commit protocol moved to TOP of builder agent prompt. Incremental commits every 3-4 files. Prevents worktree file loss (66% failure rate in Axel LMS build) (#105)
- **Auto-update rollback** — If update fails, automatically restores from backup. Backup cleanup after 7 days (#105)
- **Scan Responsibility Matrix** — Each check has ONE owner. No agent duplication. Watcher=continuous, QA=final gate, Design Reviewer=visual (#105)
- **Task Auto-Claim Protocol** — Builder, Debugger, QA, Technical Writer auto-claim tasks tagged with `[build]`/`[bug]`/`[qa]`/`[docs]` from TaskList (#105)
- **Research→Build dependency** — Tasks with `addBlockedBy` prevent builders from starting integration code before research completes (#105)
- **Steve Jobs** — Product vision added to framework philosophy. "Say no to 1000 things" (#105)

### Changed
- **Code Reviewer → Opus** — Security gate gets the best model. Benchmark-backed: Opus catches 1-2 more vulnerabilities per 10 reviews than Sonnet (#105)
- **Framework Evolver → Sonnet** — Architectural reasoning needs Sonnet, not Haiku (#105)
- **Design Reviewer gets Bash** — Can now run automated design token compliance checks (#105)
- **Watcher delta monitoring** — Continuous loop that only re-checks changed files, not full scans (#105)
- **Merge strategy** — `git checkout <branch> -- <files>` instead of `git merge` (avoids untracked file conflicts) (#105)
- **jq → soft requirement** — Installation continues without jq; hooks degrade gracefully (#105)
- **Linux install guidance** — Platform-aware instructions (apt/dnf) (#105)
- **Teams TL;DR** — Quick-start section at top of 349-line skill (#105)
- **Cost-management expanded** — From 28 to 60 lines with model cost table and context indicators (#105)
- **Builder HTML→React translation** — 7-step guide for converting DNA HTML pages to React/Tailwind components (#105)

### Fixed
- **GitHub repo reference** — `lfrfrfl` → `lsfdsb` in install.sh (broke first-time installs) (#105)
- **Missing script warnings** — Removed `enforce-commit-msg`, `log-subagent`, `post-compact` from session-context hook check (#105)
- **Security regex hardened** — GitHub tokens (ghp_30+ chars), OpenAI keys (sk-*-* with hyphens) now detected (#105)
- **PRD detection simplified** — 2 canonical checks instead of 4 fragile fallbacks (#105)
- **CLAUDE.md rules 1-19** — Fixed numbering (was 1-12, 16-19, 13-15) (#105)
- **Stale counts everywhere** — README, about skill, init skill, install guide all now show correct numbers (29 skills, 9 agents, 23 scripts, 659 tests) (#105)
- **test-all.sh** — Now runs all 4 suites with correct count parsing for agents output format (#105)
- **test-agents.sh** — Fixed syntax error (stray `fi`) and unbound `ROSTER_AGENTS` variable (#105)
- **Log rotation** — handle-failure.sh trims to 200 lines when exceeding 500 (#105)
- **health-check.sh** — Removed reference to deleted `enforce-commit-msg.sh` (#105)
- **test-simulation.sh** — Replaced stale `enforce-commit-msg` assertion (#105)

### Removed
- **CRM Patterns Expansion** — Moved to [Unreleased] in previous version, now part of v5.11.2 scope
- remove fake testing — sentinel, self-test, observatory (#104)

## [5.11.2] — 2026-03-19 — Design DNA Distribution + Framework Tooling

### Added
- **VERSION file** — Single source of truth for framework version, read dynamically by session-context.sh (was hardcoded 5.7.0 fallback)
- **Design DNA installation** — install.sh now copies all 14 Design DNA pages (hub, design-system, landing, crm, ecommerce, saas, blog, portfolio, social, lms, presentation, ebook, email, backoffice) + 2 JS modules (palette.js, svg-backgrounds.js) to new projects at `docs/design-dna/`
- **64 Design DNA tests** — Comprehensive validation suite covering page existence, palette integrity, CRM expansion (10+ patterns), rings fullscreen coverage, pipeline wiring, navigation persistence (352 total tests, all passing)
- **Design DNA dev server** — dev-server.sh auto-detects and starts DNA server (port 3001) when running in APEX framework repo
- **/ship skill** — Fast-track PR workflow: branch → commit → push → create PR → merge in single command; supports draft mode, auto-merge on approval, and configurable commit scopes

### Changed
- README.md updated with v5.11 nomenclature

### Details
- Tests validate all 14 DNA pages load palette.js and svg-backgrounds.js
- CRM expansion verified: 18 component sections (10+ required)

## [5.11.1] — 2026-03-19 — Design DNA Enforcement + Agent Hardening

### Added
- **Watcher DNA Compliance** — Watcher scans new page/screen components for Design DNA references and flags hardcoded Tailwind palette colors as design token violations (#85)

### Fixed
- **Technical Writer Rewrite** — Gap detection first: audits git log + merged PRs against CHANGELOG before writing. Self-verifies all PRs are documented. Lead spawn instructions now require specific change descriptions (#84)

## [5.11.0] — 2026-03-18 — Design DNA Integration

### Added
- **CRM Patterns Expansion** — CRM page scaled from 5 to 15 components: deal detail drawer, contact profile, pipeline analytics + funnel, lead scoring with SVG progress rings, data table with search/filters/pagination, filter bar with active tags, task/follow-up list with due dates, 2 empty state variants, email composer, notes panel
- **Design DNA Wired into Build Pipeline** — CLAUDE.md rule #16 enforces DNA page lookup; design-system SKILL.md routing table for all 14 pages + 2 JS modules; builder.md agent with mandatory DNA checks; design-reviewer.md agent with DNA compliance gate (BLOCK on violations); components.md and reference.md updated
- **Design DNA Pattern Library** — 15-page premium UI showcase at `docs/design-dna/`
  - Hub (animated SVG background, constellation nodes, floating orbs)
  - Design System (tokens, typography, spacing scale, 8 motion demos, component states, radii, shadows)
  - Landing Page (hero, bento features, pricing, testimonials, CTA, footer)
  - CRM + Helpdesk (pipeline kanban, contact cards, activity timeline, live chat, ticket list)
  - E-Commerce (product grid, detail view, cart, order summary, checkout steps)

  - Email Templates (welcome, verification, receipt, shipping, password reset, invitation, payment failed, weekly digest)
  - Backoffice (user management, activity logs, invoices, permission matrix)
  - SVG Patterns (14 static patterns + 8 animated backgrounds)
- **Global Palette Switcher** (`palette.js`) — 5 palettes (SaaS, Editorial, Fintech, Startup, Creative) × 2 modes (dark/light) = 10 themes. Persists across pages via localStorage
- **SVG Background Library** (`svg-backgrounds.js`) — 14 static patterns (dots, grid, topo, circuit, hexagons, crosses, diamonds, diagonals, triangles, constellation, isometric, waves, dna, noise) + 8 animated backgrounds (orbs, aurora, particles, gradient, rings, matrix, nebula, spotlight)
- **Background Widget** — Floating pattern/animation picker on every page

- `tests/fixtures/` — 18 Claude Code hook JSON payloads matching official schema
- **Unified Design Widget** — Merged palette switcher + background selector into single icon; palette dots, dark/light mode, 14 static patterns, 9 animated backgrounds all in one panel (#81)

### Fixed
- **Rings background fills screen** — Rings animated background now uses `vmax × 1.5` + `transform: scale()` for full-viewport coverage; 5 rings staggered over 8s eliminates visible reset flash (#80)
- **Worktree commit protocol** — Builders MUST `git commit` before reporting done to prevent file loss (4+ incidents). Lead never rewrites files — re-spawns builder with `isolation: none`. Added recovery protocol and stale worktree cleanup (#82)

### Changed

- **Agent Activity section** — `/api/activity` endpoint and dashboard view showing teams, members, and task status
- **framework-evolver** added to CLAUDE.md roster and teams skill
- `tests/test-agents.sh` — Golden Script: 137-test agent validation suite (frontmatter, tools, skills, conflicts, isolation, model fitness)

### Changed
- Technical Writer agent: upgraded to `background: true` + `permissionMode: dontAsk`
- Technical Writer agent: explicit instruction to MUST edit files (fix Haiku hallucination)
- Code Reviewer and QA agents: `isolation: worktree` → `isolation: none` (need real project state)
- Output style enforces always-on agent rule — blocks commits/PRs without Technical Writer
- CLAUDE.md: "Always-On Agents" section added above team spawn rules
- Sentinel agent: maxTurns increased from 50 to 60, report format updated for Phase 8
- Self-Test skill: complete rewrite with quick mode (structural) and full mode (integration proof)
- **StatusLine v2 rewrite** — Simplified from 15 segments to 7; removed custom agent tracking (Claude Code handles natively); graceful cold start; fixed dead code and MAX heuristic
- **Ive Audit**: 6 redundant scripts deleted (auto-approve-safe, enforce-commit-msg, notify, log-subagent, pre-compact, post-compact)
- 7 hook sections removed from settings.json (PermissionRequest, PreCompact, PostCompact, SubagentStop, Notification, InstructionsLoaded, enforce-commit-msg)
- Silent failure pattern fixed: 6 safety-critical scripts now emit `systemMessage` JSON when jq missing instead of silently exiting

- Observatory activity endpoint — tasks filtered by known teams, no stray UUIDs
- StatusLine cold start — shows "🟢 ready" instead of "0/0"
- StatusLine dead code — removed redundant health check, duplicate model ID check
- StatusLine MAX plan heuristic — now requires tokens > 0
- StatusLine PR timeout race condition — validates PR URLs must start with https://github.com/

### Removed
- Custom agent tracking in statusline (abbrev_agent, /tmp/apex-agents*.json reading)
- StatusLine "This is the way." branding suffix
- `auto-approve-safe.sh` — redundant with settings.json allow list
- `enforce-commit-msg.sh` — redundant with git's native commit-msg hook
- `notify.sh` — redundant with Claude Code's native Notification hook
- `log-subagent.sh` — dead code (was empty)
- `pre-compact.sh` / `post-compact.sh` — redundant with native compaction + auto-memory

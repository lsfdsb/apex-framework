## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Proactive `/evolve` suggestion — error counter tracks failures, suggests `/evolve` at 5/10/20 errors (#46)

- `/prd` skill auto-generates README.md from PRD content after document creation (#46)
- No silent skips — all hooks provide feedback for every exit path (#45)
- Block `git commit` on main/master — catches mistakes at commit time, not push time (#38)
- Branch pre-flight check in `/commit` skill — Step 0 verifies branch before staging (#38)
- Push-to-main error now includes exact recovery recipe (#38)
